Each metric was ranked by finding the mean for that data set and determining the number of standard deviations that the measuring factor is away from it.

The playground set was ranked based off of the quantity of playgrounds in terms of population. For each neighborhood, the number of playgrounds was divided by the total population. Then, this number was multiplied by 1,000 to determine the number of playgrounds per 1,000 people.

The income metric was ranked based off estimated income per person. The aggregate household income over a year (2015) was divided by the total population.

The third data set was ranked by the percentage of environmental risks in that area. To determine this, the percentages for landslide prone area and flood plain were added together. For this particualr data set, the rank number was multipled by 2. This was done so  the number was equally as significant as the other factors when calculating the final scores.

To determine the best neighborhood, the ranks of each of these metrics were added together. Then, they were sorted based on this score from the highest to the lowest. The highest indicates the best neighborhood.
